## Usage Tips

### Audio Reactivity

Most shaders in the AS-StageFX collection include audio reactivity options. Here are some tips for getting the most out of these features:

1. **Listeningway Integration:** Install [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway) for full audio responsiveness. Without it, shaders will still work but won't react to sound.

2. **Audio Source Selection:** Each shader with audio reactivity includes an "Audio Source" dropdown. Choose the appropriate source for your needs:
   - **Bass**: Good for rhythmic pulsing effects
   - **Mids**: Works well for vocals and most instruments
   - **Treble**: Better for high-frequency response (cymbals, etc.)
   - **Volume**: Overall audio volume (good for general reactivity)
   - **Custom**: Allows using a specific frequency band

3. **Adjusting Sensitivity:** Use the "Audio Reactivity" slider to control how strongly the effect responds to audio. Higher values create more dramatic effects.

### Performance Considerations

Visual effects can be layered strategically for the best results:

1. Apply visual effects in a meaningful order (e.g., water surface before rain)
2. Adjust depth settings to position effects at appropriate distances
3. Use blend modes strategically to achieve the desired layering

### Combining Visual Effects

For professional-looking results:

1. Don't overuse effects - pick 2-3 that complement each other
2. Consider thematic consistency (e.g., water + rain + reflections)
3. Pay attention to depth settings to create a sense of space
