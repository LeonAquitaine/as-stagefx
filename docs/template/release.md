## Installation

1.  **Download:** Get the `as-stagefx-${VERSION}.zip` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases/tag/${VERSION}).
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the archive. You will find `shaders` and `textures` folders.
3.  **Copy Files:**
    *   Copy the `AS` folder (from the extracted `shaders` folder) into your game's `reshade-shaders\Shaders\` directory.
    *   Copy the contents of the extracted `textures` folder into your game's `reshade-shaders\Textures\` directory (create it if needed).
    *   *Example Paths:*
        ```
        ...\YourGame\reshade-shaders\Shaders\AS\
        ...\YourGame\reshade-shaders\Textures\
        ```
4.  **Activate:** Launch your game, open the ReShade overlay (`Home` key), and enable the desired `AS_` shaders from the list. Reload shaders (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) if needed.
