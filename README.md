## Description

AS-StageFX provides a collection of performant, customizable, and audio-reactive visual effects shaders for ReShade. These are designed for screen capture, video recording, streaming, and virtual photography.

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
* **ReShade**: Latest version ([reshade.me](https://reshade.me/)).
* **(Optional) Listeningway**: For audio reactivity ([github.com/gposingway/Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway)).

**Steps:**
1.  **Download:** Get the [latest release ZIP](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases/latest).
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the archive.
3.  **Copy Shaders:** Place the `AS` folder (from `shaders` in the download) into your game's `reshade-shaders\Shaders` directory.
    * **Example:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\reshade-shaders\Shaders\AS`
4.  **Activate:** Launch the game. Open ReShade overlay (default: `Home` key). Reload shaders if needed (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or via settings). AS-StageFX shaders (prefix `AS_`) will be in the list.

## Core Capabilities

-   **Audio Integration:** Most effects utilize [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway) for dynamic parameter reaction to volume, beat, bass, treble, or specific frequency bands.
-   **Depth Awareness:** Many shaders interact with scene geometry (via depth buffer) for integration, masking, and occlusion.
-   **Customization:** Extensive controls for color, intensity, speed, position, blend modes, and audio source per effect.
