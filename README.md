## AS StageFX - Shader Collection for ReShade

AS StageFX is a collection of high-quality visual effects shaders for ReShade, designed with performance, customization, and audio reactivity in mind. These shaders are perfect for screenshots, videos, streaming, and virtual photography.

### Latest Updates

**2025-05-09: Shader Updates & Fixes (v1.6.1)**
- **AS_VFX_WarpDistort.1.fx**:
    - Removed rotation controls; effect is now screen-aligned.
    - Standardized position controls (`WarpCenter`): default (0,0) is screen center, UI range +/-1 maps to the central screen square.
    - Clarified `MirrorShape` behavior: "Circular" (default, value 0) applies aspect correction for a true circle; "Resolution-Relative" (value 1) does not, allowing shape to conform to screen aspect.
    - Updated documentation header to reflect these changes.
- General review and updates to other shader names and descriptions for consistency and clarity.

**2025-05-08: Maintenance Update**
- Added robust Perlin Noise functions to AS_Utils.1.fxh
- Fixed Glass Roughness in AS_VFX_RainyWindow.1.fx to properly affect droplet shapes
- Improved resolution independence in AS_BGX_MeltWave.1.fx
- Fixed rotation direction consistency in AS_BGX_MeltWave.1.fx
- Removed deprecated Border Intensity parameter from AS_BGX_MeltWave.1.fx
- Standardized magic number handling across shaders

## Overview

**AS-StageFX** is a set of dynamic lighting, audio visualizers, and special effects. Initially focused on stage lighting, the collection also includes glitter, glitch, warp, and other creative effects. Whether you're capturing gpose shots, creating machinima, setting the scene for a virtual concert, or adding unique flair to your visuals, these shaders provide customizable tools.

Most shaders feature seamless integration with **[Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway)** for audio reactivity.

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
* **ReShade**: Ensure you have the latest version of [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) installed for your target application (e.g., FFXIV).
* **(Optional) Listeningway**: For audio reactivity, install [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway). Highly recommended for most shaders in this pack.

**Steps:**
1. **Download:** [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases/latest) containing the shaders from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases).
2. **Extract Files:** Unzip the downloaded archive.
3. **Copy Shaders:** Place the `AS` folder (which is inside the `shaders` folder from the download) into your game's `reshade-shaders\Shaders` directory.
   * **Example Path:** 
     ```
     C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\reshade-shaders\Shaders\AS
     ```
4. **Launch & Activate:** Start your game. Open the ReShade overlay (usually the `Home` key) and reload your shaders if necessary (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or via settings). You should now find the **AS-StageFX** shaders (prefixed with `AS_`) in the shader list. Enable the ones you wish to use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Deep Audio Integration:** Most effects leverage [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway), allowing various parameters to react dynamically to volume, beat, bass, treble, or specific frequency bands.
- **Depth-Aware Effects:** Many shaders intelligently interact with scene geometry (using the depth buffer) for natural integration, masking, and occlusion.
- **Customization:** Offers extensive controls for colors, intensity, speed, positioning, blend modes, and audio source selection per effect.
