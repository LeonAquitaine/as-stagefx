**A suite of dynamic, audio-reactive visual effect shaders for ReShade, with a focus on video production and virtual performance art.**

---

## Overview

**AS-StageFX** is a set of dynamic lighting, audio visualizers, and special effects. Initially focused on stage lighting, the collection also includes glitter, glitch, warp, and other creative effects. Whether you're capturing gpose shots, creating machinima, setting the scene for a virtual concert, or adding unique flair to your visuals, these shaders provide customizable tools.

Most shaders feature seamless integration with **[Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway)** for audio reactivity.

### Latest Updates (May 8, 2025)
- Split documentation for better readability - detailed shader gallery now in [GALLERY.md](docs/GALLERY.md)
- Added new `stanh()` function to AS_Utils.1.fxh for improved hyperbolic tangent calculation stability
- Enhanced AS_BGX_ZippyZaps with original color mode, inverted Arc Flow Factor, and improved audio reactivity targets
- Fixed audio reactivity for Arc Flow Factor to correctly respond to audio intensity
- Updated default values in ZippyZaps for better visual quality
- Updated version to 1.0.4.2

### Previous Updates (May 5, 2025)
- Fixed AS_getTime() function in AS_Utils.1.fxh to properly detect when Listeningway is active
- Improved SparkleBloom shader with edge control parameter and better code standards compliance
- Replaced magic numbers with named constants in various shaders for better maintainability
- Updated version to 1.0.4.1

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
* **ReShade**: Ensure you have the latest version of [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) installed for your target application (e.g., FFXIV).
* **(Optional) Listeningway**: For audio reactivity, install [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway). Highly recommended for most shaders in this pack.

**Steps:**
1. **Download:** [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases/latest) containing the shaders from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/LeonAquitaine/as-stagefx/releases).
2. **Extract Files:** Unzip the downloaded archive.
3. **Copy Shaders:** Place the `AS` folder (which is inside the `shaders` folder from the download) into your game's `reshade-shaders\Shaders` directory.
   * **Example Path:** 
     ```
     C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\reshade-shaders\Shaders\AS
     ```
4. **Launch & Activate:** Start your game. Open the ReShade overlay (usually the `Home` key) and reload your shaders if necessary (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or via settings). You should now find the **AS-StageFX** shaders (prefixed with `AS_`) in the shader list. Enable the ones you wish to use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Deep Audio Integration:** Most effects leverage [Listeningway](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway), allowing various parameters to react dynamically to volume, beat, bass, treble, or specific frequency bands.
- **Depth-Aware Effects:** Many shaders intelligently interact with scene geometry (using the depth buffer) for natural integration, masking, and occlusion.
- **Customization:** Offers extensive controls for colors, intensity, speed, positioning, blend modes, and audio source selection per effect.
