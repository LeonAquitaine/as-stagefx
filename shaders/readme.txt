AS-StageFX Shader Collection
============================

Installation Instructions:

1. Copy the entire 'AS' folder (this folder) into your game's 'reshade-shaders\Shaders' directory.
   Example path:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\reshade-shaders\Shaders\AS

2. In ReShade, open the overlay (usually the Home key) and reload shaders if needed.

3. The AS-StageFX shaders will appear in the shader list, prefixed with 'AS_'. Enable the effects you want to use.

For more details and advanced usage, see the main README.md in the repository.

- AS_VFX_WaterSurface.1.fx: Realistic water surface with depth-based reflection, perspective-correct waves, and customizable color/transparency.
- AS_VFX_BrokenGlass.1.fx: Simulates broken glass overlay with customizable cracks, distortion, and color.
